Handwritten Digit Classification using Single-layer and Multi-layer Perceptron
Project Description: Handwritten Digit Classification using Single-layer and Multi-layer Perceptron

The project aims to implement handwritten digit classification using deep learning techniques, specifically utilizing both single-layer and multi-layer perceptrons. The classification task involves training a model to accurately classify handwritten digits into their respective numeric classes (0 to 9).

The project will be implemented in Python, utilizing popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow,Keras etc. It will consist of the following main components:

1. Dataset: The MNIST dataset will be used, which is a well-known benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification. It contains a large collection of labeled images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels) along with their corresponding numeric labels.

2. Data Preprocessing: The dataset will be preprocessed to prepare it for training and testing the models. This includes splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, normalizing the pixel values etc

3. Single-layer Perceptron: The first approach will involve implementing a single-layer perceptron for digit classification. The pixel values of the images will serve as input features, and the model will learn a set of weights and biases to make predictions. The model will use a suitable activation function (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU) to introduce non-linearity.

4. Training and Evaluation: The single-layer perceptron model will be trained on the training dataset using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). During training, the model will update its weights and biases to minimize the classification error. The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP): The second approach will involve implementing a multi-layer perceptron (also known as a feed-forward neural network). This model will consist of multiple layers of artificial neurons, allowing for more complex representations of the handwritten digits. The MLP will incorporate hidden layers with varying numbers of neurons and utilize suitable activation functions and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout) to improve performance and prevent overfitting.

6. Training and Evaluation: Similar to the single-layer perceptron, the MLP model will be trained on the training dataset using an optimization algorithm like SGD. The model's performance will be evaluated on the testing dataset, and the results will be compared with the single-layer perceptron to determine the improvement achieved by the multi-layer architecture.

7. Model Deployment and Visualization: Once the models are trained and evaluated, they can be saved and deployed to classify handwritten digits in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the project can include visualizations to showcase the model's predictions and provide insights into the learned representations.

By implementing both single-layer and multi-layer perceptron models for handwritten digit classification, this project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and improvements achieved by utilizing deeper architectures in solving more complex tasks. It provides a hands-on understanding of deep learning concepts and their practical applications in image classification.
